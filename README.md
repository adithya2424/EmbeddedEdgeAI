# üöÄ‚ú® **EmbeddedEdgeAI**: Neural Networks Unleashed on Edge Devices üß†[üî≤]‚ö°Ô∏è

## Welcome to the EmbeddedEdgeAI repository, where we focus on optimizing AI models for embedded and edge computing devices through advanced techniques.

## Quick Links

- [Optimization Algorithms](OptimizationAlgorithms.md) - Explore our detailed experiments and guides on optimization algorithms such as model pruning, quantization, knowledge distillation
- [Demos on ARM Cortex-M Series](/Demos/) - Witness the thrilling execution of our models on ARM Cortex M4 based devices in real-time.

### Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/adithya2424/EmbeddedEdgeAI.git
cd EmbeddedEdgeAI
```

## Contributing

Contributions are warmly welcomed! If you have suggestions for improvements or ideas for new features, please feel free to submit an issue or a pull request. Your input is greatly valued as it helps make this project even better for everyone.

## Note:

I will add support code for the deployment of these optimized models in STM32 NUCLEO boards very soon. I am open to collaborate with fellow innovators.

## Acknowledgments

This project incorporates code from the course "MIT 6.5940 EfficientML.ai," offered in Fall 2023. The course provided valuable insights and examples that have been adapted and used in this project. I extend my gratitude to the course instructors and MIT for making such resources available.

For more information about the course and its materials, please visit [MIT 6.5940 EfficientML.ai Fall 2023](https://hanlab.mit.edu/courses/2023-fall-65940) or the course's direct link if available.

## Final Remarks

Crafted with love ‚ù§Ô∏è and passion for the Embedded Edge AI. Let's innovate together! üöÄ‚ú®
